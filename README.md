# Hell's Bells Game Live 
Deployed on Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme<br>
This repo has been forked from the Minimal Mistakes blog theme, so that I can deploy this Unity game on Github Pages.<br>
<br>
28 April 2019 - This was unnecessarily complicated and overformats the game window inside a blog entry, copied this idea from another blog but not good way to host game I think.<br>
<br>
See <a href = "https://github.com/LondonWillGeorge/HellsBells_UnityGame">HellsBells_UnityGame</a> repo for AWS website now deploying to.
Old attempt at SIMMER.io also, JSON doesn't load on this one probably file name issue which was fixed on AWS version:
